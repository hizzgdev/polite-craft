A match pattern is a URL with the following structure, used to specify a group of URLs:

    <scheme>://<host>/<path>

**scheme** : Must be one of the following, separated from the rest of the pattern using a colon followed by a double slash (`://`):

- `http`
- `https`
- A wildcard `*`, which matches only `http` or `https`
- `file`

For information on injecting content scripts into unsupported schemes, such as `about:` and `data:`, see [Injecting in related frames](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/develop/concepts/content-scripts#injecting-in-related-frames).

**host** : A hostname (`www.example.com`). A `*` before the hostname to match subdomains (`*.example.com`), or just a wildcard `*`.
- If you use a wildcard in the host pattern, it must be the first or only character, and it must be followed by a period (`.`) or forward slash (`/`).

**path** : A URL path (`/example`). For host permissions, the path is required but ignored. The wildcard (`/*`) should be used by convention.

Extensions use match patterns in a variety of use cases, including the following:

- Injecting [content script](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/develop/concepts/content-scripts).
- [Declaring host permissions](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/develop/concepts/declare-permissions#host-permissions) that some Chrome APIs require in addition to their own permissions.
- Granting access to [web-accessible resources](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/manifest/web-accessible-resources#manifest-declaration).
- Allowing message sending and receiving using the ["externally_connectable.matches"](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/manifest/externally-connectable#manifest) manifest key.

## Special cases

`"<all_urls>"`
:   Matches any URL that starts with a permitted scheme, including any pattern listed under [valid patterns](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/develop/concepts/match-patterns#examples). Because it affects all hosts, Chrome web store reviews for extensions that use it [may take longer](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/webstore/review-process#review-time-factors).

`"file:///"`
:   Allows your extension to run on local files. This pattern requires the user to manually [grant access](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/develop/concepts/declare-permissions#allow_access). Note that this case requires three slashes, not two.

Localhost URLs and IP addresses
:   To match any localhost port during development, use `http://localhost/*`. For IP addresses, specify the address plus a wildcard in the path, as in `http://127.0.0.1/*`. You can also use `http://*:*/*` to match localhost, IP addresses, and any port.

Top Level domain match patterns
:   Chrome doesn't support match patterns for [top Level domains (TLD)](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Glossary/TLD). Specify your match patterns within individual TLDs, as in `http://google.es/*` and `http://google.fr/*`.

## Example patterns

`https://*/*` or `https://*/`
:   Matches any URL using the `https` scheme.

`https://*/foo*`
:   Matches any URL using the `https` scheme, on any host, with a path that starts with `foo`. Examples of matches include `https://example.com/foo/bar.html` and `https://www.google.com/foo`.

`https://*.google.com/foo*bar`
:   Matches any URL using the `https` scheme, on a google.com host, with a path that starts with `foo` and ends with `bar`. Examples of matches include `https://www.google.com/foo/baz/bar` and `https://docs.google.com/foobar`.

`file:///foo*`
:   Matches any local file whose path starts with `foo`. Examples of matches include `file:///foo/bar.html` and `file:///foo`.

`http://127.0.0.1/*` or `http://127.0.0.1/`
:   Matches any URL that uses the `http` scheme and is on the host 127.0.0.1. Examples of matches include `http://127.0.0.1/` and `http://127.0.0.1/foo/bar.html`.

`http://localhost/*`
:   Matches any localhost port.

`*://mail.google.com/` or `*://mail.google.com/*`
:   Matches any URL that starts with `http://mail.google.com` or `https://mail.google.com`.
